# Week 2 Documentation
This week, I presented the four python problems I made last week to the class. 

## F-Strings
- The class understood f-strings immediately
- Was taught using white-board
```
name = input()
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# input: Nathan
# output: Hello, Nathan!
```

## If-statements
- The class already knew if-strings due to their experience in Computer Science Principles, so the only new thing was syntax
- I accidentally miswrote the syntax in the form of:
``if <condition>:`` instead of ``if condition:``
- After correcting that error, there were no more questions and everyone solved the problem efficiently

## Functions
- This was a part of Javascript that the class was less familiar with, so I had to spend a little more time teaching it
- I then taught them the syntax:
```
def addition(arg1, arg2)s:
    return arg1 + arg2
```
- The challenge introduced lots of unknowns, such as python module, the *random* module, and the **try-catch** statement
    - The students were left to learn this themselves
    - w3schools and occasional advice from me led to most students being able to attempt the challenges

## Challenge
- After everything that the class had done that period, there was nothing they needed to solve the problem.
- A few students came up with a better solution than me, by putting each operation in a function
