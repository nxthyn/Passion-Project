# Python Problems
### F-Strings
In this problem you will have to learn how to use f-strings to accomplish the goal.
<br>
Prompt the user to input their name, then output the following: <br>
``Hello [Name]`` <br>
With **[Name]** as the user's input.
### If-statements
In this problem you are going to make a guessing game!<br>
The user will input a number as a guess, and the code will display whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct. <br>
You will hard code in the number they guess.
### Functions
In this problem you will give the user two options:
1. Roll a Die
2. Flip a Coin 

The user will then type either a 1 or a 2, and the corresponding random choice will be made. The die roll and the coin flip have to be in different functions that are called when the user puts input.
<br>
 My advice is to use the Python **random** module. (w3 schools can be a great resource)
### Challenge: Calculator
In this problem you are trying to design a 
calculator in python, but you have limited tools at your disposal.
<br>
The user should input three things:
1. The first number
2. The mathematical operator
3. The second number

The user should then receive an output of the result of the python operation.
<br>
Make sure to use an if-statement and a function. Bragging points if you can figure out how to use an f-string *well*. <br>
Remember to make your code look good and to make the user experience as clean as possible.
You may tell the user to restrict input.
