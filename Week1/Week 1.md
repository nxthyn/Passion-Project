This week I visited Ms. Bownds AP Computer Science Principles class to assist her in helping them prepare for the AP test and teaching them Python.
In class, I walked around and helped anyone that was struggling with the textbook, and I also developed my own easy challenge for them to complete:
**Problem**: 
Calculate your age (with one year margin of error) using only the current year and the year you were born.
**Answer**:
```
current_year = 2024
birth_year = 2005 # this is my birth year

age = current_year - birth_year
print("I am " + age + " years old!") # while an f-string is easier, they have yet to learn them
```

I then was tasked by Bownds to come up with some Python problems for her. I decided to make four somewhat challenging problems, that require the students to do some research and learn new skills. That set of instructions and answer keys will be in the same directory in the repository as this file.
